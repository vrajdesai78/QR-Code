# QR Generator for College ID

A Quick Response Code or a QR Code is a two-dimensional bar code used for its fast readability and comparatively large storage capacity. It consists of black squares arranged in a square grid on a white background.

Python has a library “qrcode” for generating QR code images. It can be installed using pip. 

```sh
pip install qrcode
```

For software requirements, I suggest that your system should be installed with an <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">anaconda environment</a> and satisfied the library requirements.

Among the many uses for QR codes, this project fits the college ID use case, making it user-friendly and interesting for students.
